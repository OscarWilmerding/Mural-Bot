These are all PCT patents, filed internationally. This means they were filed with the intent to file them in respective countries, BUT THEY WERE NEVER FILED IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES. It is my understanding these cannot be used in a legal sense and do not protect the IP. 

One of them was filed in Europe but withdrawn.
